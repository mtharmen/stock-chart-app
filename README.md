# Free Code Camp Challenge: [Build a Stock Chart App](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pinterest-clone)

### Legacy branch using ReactJS front-end and older back-end

##User stories:
1. I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
2. I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
3. I can remove stocks.
4. I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

##Possible Updates:
1. Update search bar so that it doesn't require the entire list of companies to be preloaded
2. Update to ES6 syntax and general clean up
